    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup finely chopped celery</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups canned plum tomatoes, drained and coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>12 green olives, pitted and coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly minced oregano</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Toss eggplant with salt and place in a colander set over a bowl. Let
        sit, about 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
        celery; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add
        onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is soft and lightly golden,
        about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl using a slotted
        spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet. Add eggplant and
        cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in celery mixture, tomatoes, olives, capers, tomato paste, and
        oregano. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until
        caponata is thickened, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season caponata with vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Transfer to
        a serving bowl and garnish with parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
